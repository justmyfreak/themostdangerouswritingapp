# About the repo
I really like [themostdangerouswritingapp](https://github.com/maebert/themostdangerouswritingapp). So I try to make the installable version of it by using [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron). 

# How to use
Download the binary from [release tab](https://github.com/justmyfreak/themostdangerouswritingapp/releases). 

# Dev guide.

$ npm install
```

## Run

```
$ npm start

### PS
A lot of things still in mess. The downloadable binary is just for OSX. It will be fixed on next release or you could build by yourself :p
